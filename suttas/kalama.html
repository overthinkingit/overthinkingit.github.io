        <h2>Context</h2>

        <p>
          The Kālāma <span class="pali" data-pali="sutta" data-en="discourse">Sutta</span>
          appears in the Aṅguttara <span class="pali" data-pali="nikāya" data-en="collection">Nikāya</span>
          (AN 3.65) and is addressed to the Kālāmas, a people of the town of Kesaputta.
          The Kālāmas describe a problem that feels remarkably contemporary: various teachers
          have visited them, each expounding their own teaching and dismissing the others.
          The Kālāmas are bewildered. How are they supposed to know who is right?
        </p>

        <p>
          The Buddha's response is the most cited passage in the Pali canon outside of
          specialist Buddhist circles, and almost certainly the most frequently misread.
          It has been held up as evidence that Buddhism is proto-scientific, compatible
          with empiricism, free of dogma, and based entirely on personal verification.
          Some of this is true. None of it quite captures what the sutta is doing.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <h2>The Ten Criteria</h2>

        <p>
          The Buddha tells the Kālāmas not to accept something as true on the basis of
          ten grounds: oral tradition, lineage of teaching, hearsay, a collection of
          texts, logic, inferential reasoning, reasoned cogitation, the acceptance of
          a view after pondering it, the seeming competence of a speaker, or the thought
          "this ascetic is my teacher."
        </p>

        <p>
          This is the passage that gets quoted most often, usually as a kind of declaration
          of intellectual independence: don't believe anything you haven't personally
          verified. But read carefully, the list rules out quite a lot that secular
          empiricism also accepts as valid — including logic and inferential reasoning.
          The Buddha is not endorsing a scientific epistemology; he is describing the
          limits of any second-hand transmission, including his own.
        </p>

        <p>
          The criterion that actually matters comes immediately after. The Kālāmas are
          to evaluate things not through external authority, logic, or tradition but
          through a direct and simple question: when these things are present in me, do
          they lead to harm or to benefit? Do they lead to
          <span class="pali" data-pali="dukkha" data-en="suffering">dukkha</span> or to
          its absence?
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          "When you know for yourselves: 'These things are unwholesome
          (<span class="pali" data-pali="akusala" data-en="unwholesome">akusala</span>),
          these things are blameworthy, these things are censured by the wise; these things,
          when undertaken and practiced, lead to harm and suffering' — then you should
          abandon them. And when you know for yourselves: 'These things are wholesome
          (<span class="pali" data-pali="kusala" data-en="wholesome">kusala</span>), blameless,
          praised by the wise; these things, when undertaken and practiced, lead to welfare
          and happiness' — then you should enter upon and abide in them."
          <cite>— AN 3.65 (adapted)</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          The standard is not empirical in any modern sense. It is ethical and experiential:
          does this quality of mind — greed, hatred, or delusion on one side;
          non-greed, non-hatred, and non-delusion on the other — lead to harm or to benefit?
          This is a question a person can answer from the inside, without reference to
          external authority. But it is not a purely subjective question — the standard
          is what "the wise" would endorse, and what one's own experience, examined
          honestly, confirms.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <h2>The Argument About Greed, Hate, and Delusion</h2>

        <p>
          To make the practical application concrete, the Buddha takes the Kālāmas through
          a direct line of questioning about greed, hatred, and delusion (lobha, dosa, moha —
          the three roots of <span class="pali" data-pali="akusala" data-en="unwholesome">akusala</span>
          action). A person overcome by greed — does that lead to harm or benefit? The
          Kālāmas confirm: to harm. By hatred? To harm. By delusion? To harm.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Buddha then walks through the opposite: a mind free of greed, free of hatred,
          free of delusion. Does that person harm others? Do they speak falsely? Do they
          live in a way that leads to suffering? In each case: no. This is not an argument
          from authority or tradition. It is an argument from consequences — from the
          observable relationship between the state of one's mind and the quality of one's
          actions and their effects.
        </p>

        <p>
          The criterion of
          <span class="pali" data-pali="kusala" data-en="wholesome">kusala</span> and
          <span class="pali" data-pali="akusala" data-en="unwholesome">akusala</span>
          is the practical one. Not "is this metaphysically true?" but "does this make
          things better or worse?" Not "did a reliable teacher tell me this?" but "when
          I look at my own experience of greed and non-greed, hatred and goodwill —
          what do I actually find?"
        </p>

        <hr>

        <h2>The Part That Is Almost Never Quoted</h2>

        <p>
          The Kālāma Sutta is regularly excerpted at its opening — the ten grounds to
          reject — and the practical criterion. What is almost never quoted is the sutta's
          conclusion, which occupies roughly half the text.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Buddha goes on to describe a practitioner who has cultivated the four
          <span class="pali" data-pali="brahmavihāra" data-en="divine abidings">brahmavihārās</span>
          — who abides with a mind imbued with
          <span class="pali" data-pali="mettā" data-en="loving-kindness">mettā</span>,
          pervading all directions without limit; then
          <span class="pali" data-pali="karuṇā" data-en="compassion">karuṇā</span>,
          <span class="pali" data-pali="muditā" data-en="appreciative joy">muditā</span>,
          and <span class="pali" data-pali="upekkhā" data-en="equanimity">upekkhā</span>.
          Such a practitioner, the Buddha says, has four "solaces" — four grounds for
          confidence regardless of what happens after death. Even if there is no afterlife
          and no kamma bearing fruit, the person who has lived with goodwill, compassion,
          joy in others' joy, and equanimity has lived well, without enmity or
          ill-will, and will be happy in this life. If there is a next life, and if good
          actions bear fruit, then there is a further good awaiting. And if good actions
          do not bear fruit, the practitioner is still a person who has lived without harm.
        </p>

        <p>
          This section reframes the sutta's opening entirely. The Kālāmas were not just
          asking which philosophical system to adopt. They were asking how to live. The
          answer the sutta ultimately gives is not epistemological — it does not end with
          a theory of knowledge. It ends with the brahmavihārās: the cultivation of goodwill
          and compassion as the practical response to uncertainty about what is ultimately true.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Reading This Sutta</h2>

        <p>
          The Kālāma Sutta is sometimes used to argue that the Buddha endorsed a kind
          of Buddhist scepticism, or that the tradition is indifferent to doctrinal
          questions. Neither reading survives a careful look at the text. The sutta
          does not say "believe whatever works for you" — it says that the criterion
          for evaluating a teaching is whether it leads to benefit or harm, and that
          greed, hatred, and delusion lead to harm while their opposites do not.
          That is not scepticism; it is a specific ethical and soteriological claim.
        </p>

        <p>
          What the sutta genuinely does do is locate the standard of evaluation in
          direct experience rather than in institutional authority or textual tradition.
          The Kālāmas — who are not even Buddhists — are invited to look at their own
          minds and ask: do greed and hatred lead to suffering? The question is put
          to them as something they can verify themselves. The answer the sutta expects
          is not "maybe" — it is "yes, and we already know this."
        </p>

        <p>
          The deeper teaching of the
          <span class="pali" data-pali="sutta" data-en="discourse">sutta</span> may be this:
          the path begins where you already are. Not with metaphysical commitment, not
          with doctrinal acceptance, but with the simple observation that some states of
          mind lead to harm and some do not. From that observation, the entire practice
          can unfold — all the way to the
          <span class="pali" data-pali="brahmavihāra" data-en="divine abidings">brahmavihārās</span>
          with which the sutta concludes.
