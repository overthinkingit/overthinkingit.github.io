      <p>
        These pages are a working record — an attempt to understand the Buddhist tradition honestly,
        from the inside out. Not as a scholar cataloguing positions, and not as a devotee defending
        a fixed view, but as someone sitting with the teachings long enough to notice when they begin
        to make sense.
      </p>

      <p>
        The tradition is old, vast, and internally diverse. What appears here draws primarily from
        the Pali canon — the earliest surviving body of Buddhist teaching — while remaining attentive
        to what later traditions developed and corrected. Nothing here is final. These are notes,
        not conclusions.
      </p>

      <h2>On the Pali language</h2>

      <p>
        Throughout these pages you will encounter words in Pali — the language in which the earliest
        Buddhist teachings were preserved.         Pali terms appear in an ochre tint with a dotted underline — like the words
        in the paragraphs that follow. They are not decorative.
      </p>

      <p>
        English translations of Pali words are always approximations. A word like
        <span class="pali" data-pali="dukkha" data-en="suffering">dukkha</span>
        is routinely translated as "suffering," but that rendering misses two of its three registers
        entirely. A word like <span class="pali" data-pali="sati" data-en="mindfulness">sati</span>
        has been so thoroughly domesticated into wellness culture that meeting it in its original
        context can feel like an introduction to a stranger you thought you knew.
      </p>

      <p>
        Clicking any highlighted Pali word will open a short note explaining the term and its
        closest English meaning. These notes appear in the right margin on larger screens.
        On a phone they expand inline. You can open several at once and close them when you are done.
      </p>

      <h2>The shape of the teaching</h2>

      <p>
        The Buddha's first discourse after his awakening turned on a single axis: the reality of
        <span class="pali" data-pali="dukkha" data-en="suffering">dukkha</span>.
        Not as a pessimistic claim about life, but as a diagnostic starting point — if we are going
        to address a problem, we have to be willing to name it. The Four Noble Truths that structure
        that first discourse are less a creed to be believed than a framework to be applied: here is
        what is wrong; here is its cause; here is the possibility of its ending; here is the path.
      </p>

      <p>
        The cause identified is <span class="pali" data-pali="tanhā" data-en="craving">tanhā</span> —
        craving, thirst. The mind's habitual reaching: for pleasant things, for continued existence,
        for the absence of what it finds unpleasant. This reaching is not incidental to suffering;
        it is its mechanism.
        <span class="pali" data-pali="upadāna" data-en="clinging">Upadāna</span>,
        the consolidation of that craving into clinging, follows naturally — and from clinging, the
        whole edifice of continued becoming.
      </p>

      <p>
        Against this, the tradition identifies three characteristics shared by all conditioned
        experience: <span class="pali" data-pali="anicca" data-en="impermanence">anicca</span>,
        <span class="pali" data-pali="dukkha" data-en="suffering">dukkha</span>, and
        <span class="pali" data-pali="anattā" data-en="non-self">anattā</span>. The first —
        impermanence — is perhaps easiest to accept intellectually. It becomes more destabilising
        when turned toward the things we are clinging to. The third — non-self — is the one that
        tends to stop people mid-sentence.
      </p>

      <h2>The path</h2>

      <p>
        The Buddha was not primarily a metaphysician. He was, in his own formulation, someone who
        had found a way out of a problem and was describing that way clearly enough for others to
        follow. The Noble Eightfold Path is the practical body of that description.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is often grouped into three trainings: <span class="pali" data-pali="sīla" data-en="virtue">sīla</span>
        (ethical conduct), <span class="pali" data-pali="samādhi" data-en="concentration">samādhi</span>
        (unification of mind), and <span class="pali" data-pali="paññā" data-en="wisdom">paññā</span>
        (wisdom). The three do not run in sequence so much as they deepen one another. A settled
        ethical life creates the conditions for stillness; stillness clears the ground for
        direct seeing; direct seeing refines the ethical sensibility. The path spirals.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the heart of the meditative dimension is
        <span class="pali" data-pali="sati" data-en="mindfulness">sati</span> —
        clear, present-moment awareness that neither grasps nor recoils. The Buddha described it
        through four foundations: the body, <span class="pali" data-pali="vedanā" data-en="feeling-tone">vedanā</span>
        (the bare pleasant/unpleasant/neutral quality of each moment of experience), mind states,
        and the nature of phenomena. What sati notices — consistently, without preference — becomes
        the raw material from which <span class="pali" data-pali="paññā" data-en="wisdom">paññā</span>
        arises.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        "Monks, I do not say that the attainment of wisdom is all at once. Rather, the attainment
        of wisdom is by gradual training, gradual practice, gradual progress."
        <cite>— AN 3.65 (adapted)</cite>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        The seven <span class="pali" data-pali="bojjhaṅgā" data-en="factors of awakening">bojjhaṅgā</span>
        describe what a mind in the process of awakening looks and feels like from the inside —
        alive, curious, energised, and yet growing increasingly still. At the end of that movement
        is <span class="pali" data-pali="upekkhā" data-en="equanimity">upekkhā</span>: the open, 
        unshakeable quality that is sometimes called equanimity and sometimes called the heart
        of <span class="pali" data-pali="nibbāna" data-en="liberation">nibbāna</span> itself.
      </p>

      <h2>How to use these pages</h2>

      <p>
        The site is divided into three main sections. <a href="concepts/index.html">Concepts</a>
        takes up core ideas one at a time — the aggregates, dependent origination, the jhānas,
        and others. <a href="suttas/index.html">Suttas</a> looks at specific discourses: what they
        contain, how they are structured, what they ask of the reader.
        <a href="thoughts/index.html">Thoughts</a> is the less tidy section — longer pieces where
        I am trying to work something out.
      </p>

      <p>
        Everything here is a draft in the sense that understanding changes. If something seems
        wrong or is missing important nuance, that is probably because I have not got there yet.
        The path spirals.
