        <h2>Context</h2>

        <p>
          The Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta appears twice in the Pali canon: as MN 10 in the Majjhima
          <span class="pali" data-pali="nikāya" data-en="collection">Nikāya</span> (the
          middle-length discourses) and, in a longer version with an expanded final section
          on the four noble truths, as DN 22. The sutta is addressed to the
          <span class="pali" data-pali="bhikkhu" data-en="monks">bhikkhus</span> while the
          Buddha is staying in Kammāsadhamma, a town in the Kuru country. The occasion is
          not recorded as any particular crisis or question — it is simply the Buddha's
          decision to teach what he describes, in the opening sentence, as "the direct path."
        </p>

        <p>
          That opening declaration is worth pausing over. The Pali is
          <em>ekāyano ayaṃ maggo</em> — "this is the one-way path," "the direct path,"
          or "the path going only one way." The claim is strong: the four
          <span class="pali" data-pali="satipaṭṭhāna" data-en="foundations of mindfulness">satipaṭṭhānas</span>
          are "for the purification of beings, for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation,
          for the disappearance of pain and grief, for the attainment of the true way, for
          the realisation of <span class="pali" data-pali="nibbāna" data-en="liberation">nibbāna</span>."
          This is not a side practice or a preparation for the real teaching — it is the
          teaching.
        </p>

        <h2>The Four Foundations</h2>

        <p>
          Each foundation is a domain in which
          <span class="pali" data-pali="sati" data-en="mindfulness">sati</span> is established
          and sustained. The sutta works through each with a consistent structure: it names
          the foundation, describes a series of specific contemplations within it, and then
          closes each section with what is known as the refrain.
        </p>

        <h3>First Foundation: The Body (Kāya)</h3>

        <p>
          The body contemplations begin with the breath — mindfulness of the in-breath and
          out-breath as the most immediate, always-available object. A
          <span class="pali" data-pali="bhikkhu" data-en="monk">bhikkhu</span> goes to the
          forest, sits down, and simply knows: "breathing in long, I know I breathe in long;
          breathing out long, I know I breathe out long." The instruction is for clear
          knowing, not for controlling or altering the breath.
        </p>

        <p>
          The body section then expands outward: contemplation of the postures (walking,
          standing, sitting, lying down), clear comprehension of all activities, reflection
          on the body's thirty-two parts, analysis of the body into the four elements, and
          the cemetery contemplations — nine increasingly direct meditations on the
          decomposition of a corpse. This last sequence is not morbid art; it is a systematic
          dismantling of the body's apparent solidity and permanence, applied with the same
          clarity as the breath meditation.
        </p>

        <h3>Second Foundation: Feeling-tone (Vedanā)</h3>

        <p>
          The second foundation is
          <span class="pali" data-pali="vedanā" data-en="feeling-tone">vedanā</span> —
          the bare hedonic quality, pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral, that accompanies
          every moment of experience. A <span class="pali" data-pali="bhikkhu" data-en="monk">bhikkhu</span>
          knows a pleasant feeling as a pleasant feeling; an unpleasant feeling as unpleasant;
          a neutral feeling as neutral. The sutta also distinguishes worldly feelings (those
          arising in connection with the senses) from spiritual feelings (those arising in
          connection with practice).
        </p>

        <p>
          The importance of vedanā in this framework is that it is the hinge point identified
          in <span class="pali" data-pali="paṭicca-samuppāda" data-en="dependent origination">dependent origination</span>:
          from feeling, craving arises. Establishing
          <span class="pali" data-pali="sati" data-en="mindfulness">sati</span> on vedanā
          means seeing the feeling-tone before the reactive machinery of craving and aversion
          engages. This is not suppression — it is clear seeing in the gap between stimulus
          and response.
        </p>

        <h3>Third Foundation: Mind States (Citta)</h3>

        <p>
          The third foundation is the mind itself — specifically, its current quality or
          coloring. The <span class="pali" data-pali="bhikkhu" data-en="monk">bhikkhu</span>
          knows a mind with lust as a mind with lust, a mind without lust as without lust.
          A mind with hatred as a mind with hatred; without hatred as without. A deluded mind,
          an undeluded mind; a contracted mind, a scattered mind; a developed mind, an
          undeveloped mind; a surpassed mind, an unsurpassed mind; a unified mind, an
          ununified mind; a liberated mind, an unliberated mind.
        </p>

        <p>
          The list is empirical: these are qualities that can be directly observed in one's
          own mind, right now. The instruction is not to change the quality but to know it
          accurately. A mind clouded by anger that knows itself as clouded by anger has already
          created a slight separation — a gap between the state and the awareness of the state —
          that the unreflective mind does not have. This knowing is not neutral; it is the
          beginning of being less controlled by what is seen.
        </p>

        <h3>Fourth Foundation: Phenomena (Dhammā)</h3>

        <p>
          The fourth foundation is the most expansive: the direct contemplation of
          <span class="pali" data-pali="dhamma" data-en="phenomena">dhammā</span> — phenomena
          or mental objects — as they arise and pass. This section covers five domains:
        </p>

        <p>
          The five <span class="pali" data-pali="nīvaraṇa" data-en="hindrances">nīvaraṇas</span>
          (hindrances): sensual desire, ill-will, sloth-and-torpor, restlessness-and-worry,
          and doubt. The practitioner knows when each is present, knows when it is absent,
          and knows the conditions by which an absent hindrance arises, by which an arisen
          hindrance is abandoned, and by which an abandoned hindrance does not arise again.
        </p>

        <p>
          The five <span class="pali" data-pali="khandha" data-en="aggregates">khandhas</span>
          of clinging — form, feeling-tone, perception, formations, and consciousness —
          understood as arising and passing. The six internal and external sense bases —
          eye and forms, ear and sounds, and so on — together with the fetters that arise
          dependent on them. The seven factors of awakening
          (<span class="pali" data-pali="bojjhaṅgā" data-en="factors of awakening">bojjhaṅgā</span>):
          the practitioner knows when mindfulness, investigation, energy, rapture, tranquility,
          unification, and equanimity are present or absent, and the conditions for their
          arising and development. Finally, the four noble truths themselves.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <h2>The Refrain</h2>

        <p>
          After each specific contemplation, the sutta delivers the same refrain. It appears
          dozens of times, unchanged. Its repetition is deliberate — it describes the quality
          of attention that all the contemplations share:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          "In this way, in regard to the body he abides contemplating the body internally,
          or he abides contemplating the body externally, or he abides contemplating the
          body both internally and externally. He abides contemplating the nature of arising
          in the body, or he abides contemplating the nature of passing away in the body,
          or he abides contemplating the nature of both arising and passing away in the body.
          Mindfulness that 'there is a body' is established in him to the extent necessary
          for bare knowledge and continuous mindfulness. And he abides independent, not
          clinging to anything in the world."
          <cite>— MN 10 (adapted)</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Three features of the refrain are worth noting. First, the movement between
          internal and external: sati is not only turned inward. The practitioner attends
          to their own body, then to bodies in general, then to both. This prevents the
          practice from becoming a purely private, self-absorbed exercise. Second, the explicit
          attention to arising and passing: <span class="pali" data-pali="anicca" data-en="impermanence">anicca</span>
          is not a conclusion to be drawn at the end of practice — it is the quality being
          directly attended to throughout. Third, the closing phrase: "not clinging to anything
          in the world." This is the orientation from which all the contemplations proceed.
          The practice is not a technique for becoming more comfortable; it is a systematic
          loosening of clinging.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Reading This Sutta</h2>

        <p>
          The Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta has been profoundly influential in contemporary
          Buddhist practice — arguably more so than any other text in the canon — in part
          because it is the most detailed practical account of what the practice actually
          involves. But its influence has sometimes come at the cost of flattening it.
        </p>

        <p>
          In many contemporary presentations, the sutta becomes a map of bare attention —
          a technique of present-moment awareness that is essentially neutral, suitable for
          secular stress-reduction as much as for liberation. The sutta itself is not neutral.
          It is anchored throughout in the recognition of
          <span class="pali" data-pali="anicca" data-en="impermanence">anicca</span>,
          <span class="pali" data-pali="dukkha" data-en="unsatisfactoriness">dukkha</span>,
          and <span class="pali" data-pali="anattā" data-en="non-self">anattā</span>.
          The point of seeing the body as the body, <span class="pali" data-pali="vedanā" data-en="feeling-tone">vedanā</span>
          as vedanā, mind states as mind states, is not equanimity as an end in itself —
          it is the recognition that none of what is seen is stable, satisfying, or self.
          The refrain says this explicitly: "not clinging to anything in the world."
        </p>

        <p>
          The sutta closes with a promise: one who practices in this way, for seven years —
          or seven months, or seven days — should expect either full awakening or, if there
          is a remainder of clinging, non-return. It is a strong claim. The path that the
          sutta maps is not endless. There is, the Buddha says, a shore on the other side.
