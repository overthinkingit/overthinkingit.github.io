        <p>
          <span class="pali" data-pali="jhāna" data-en="meditative absorption">Jhāna</span>
          is one of those words that has accumulated a considerable weight of mystique in the
          centuries since the Buddha used it. In contemporary contexts it is sometimes presented
          as an exotic attainment accessible only to monastics in intensive retreat — and sometimes,
          in a different direction, as nothing more than ordinary concentration that any diligent
          practitioner will easily reach. Neither characterisation is quite right.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the Pali canon, jhāna is neither rare nor trivial. It is the explicit definition of
          <span class="pali" data-pali="sammā-samādhi" data-en="right unification">sammā-samādhi</span>,
          the eighth factor of the Noble Eightfold Path. The Buddha described it in the same
          standardised language dozens of times across the canon. It is also not presented as the
          endpoint — it is the still lake in which
          <span class="pali" data-pali="paññā" data-en="wisdom">paññā</span> can see clearly.
        </p>

        <h2>The First Jhāna</h2>

        <p>
          The standard formula for the first jhāna begins with withdrawal from sensual pleasures
          and unwholesome states. The practitioner enters a unified, absorbed state characterised
          by five factors:
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="pali" data-pali="vitakka" data-en="applied thought">Vitakka</span> —
          the placing of attention on the meditation object. The mind takes up the object and
          holds it. In everyday consciousness, vitakka is the initial thinking that moves from
          one topic to the next; in jhāna, it becomes more refined — the mind still applies
          itself to the object, but without the commentary.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="pali" data-pali="vicāra" data-en="sustained thought">Vicāra</span> —
          the sustained examination of the object. Where vitakka places the mind, vicāra keeps
          it there, turning gently. Together they represent the last traces of discursive
          activity within absorption.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="pali" data-pali="pīti" data-en="rapture">Pīti</span> — the quality of
          rapture or joy that arises with the deepening of unification. This can be quite
          physical in the early stages — goosebumps, tingling, a flooding sensation in the body.
          It is a sign of deepening stillness, not a goal in itself. The tradition identifies
          five grades of pīti, from momentary to pervasive.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="pali" data-pali="sukha" data-en="pleasure / ease">Sukha</span> —
          a quieter sense of pleasure and ease. Where pīti is energetic, sukha is settled.
          The body and mind are described as "pervaded" by it.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="pali" data-pali="ekaggatā" data-en="one-pointedness">Ekaggatā</span> —
          unification of mind, the quality of the mind gathered into a single point. This is
          present in all four jhānas; it deepens as the other factors fall away.
        </p>

        <p>
          The simile the Buddha offers for the first jhāna is the kneading of bath powder with
          water: the whole mass is saturated, nothing falls outside. The point is that the
          stillness is complete and thorough, not partial.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <h2>The Second Jhāna</h2>

        <p>
          In the second jhāna, vitakka and vicāra — the discursive elements — cease. What remains
          is a simpler, more unified quality: inner confidence, stillness, a mind no longer moving
          toward the object but simply present with it. Pīti and sukha continue; ekaggatā deepens.
          The simile is a lake fed from within by cool springs — no external agitation, but a
          pervasive coolness that suffuses everything.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <h2>The Third Jhāna</h2>

        <p>
          In the third jhāna, pīti — the energetic, rapturous quality — fades. What remains is
          <span class="pali" data-pali="sukha" data-en="ease">sukha</span> and a quality of
          <span class="pali" data-pali="upekkhā" data-en="equanimity">upekkhā</span> beginning
          to emerge. The mind is described as dwelling in equanimity, with
          <span class="pali" data-pali="sati" data-en="mindfulness">sati</span> — clearly aware,
          undistracted. The noble ones, the canon says, declare this state: "one who has equanimity
          and is mindful dwells in ease." The simile is a lotus that grows in water and is
          suffused by that water, not touching the mud.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <h2>The Fourth Jhāna</h2>

        <p>
          The fourth jhāna is the most refined of the form absorptions. Sukha has dropped away
          — along with its contrast, dukkha — and what remains is the pure
          <span class="pali" data-pali="upekkhā" data-en="equanimity">upekkhā</span> of
          <span class="pali" data-pali="ekaggatā" data-en="one-pointedness">ekaggatā</span>:
          a mind that is perfectly still, perfectly aware, and perfectly balanced. The breath,
          the texts note, has become very subtle — almost imperceptible. The simile is a man
          sitting wrapped from head to foot in a white cloth, so that every part of the body
          is covered. The stillness is total.
        </p>

        <p>
          The fourth jhāna is described as the platform from which higher attainments arise:
          the formless absorptions, the supernormal knowledges, and — most significantly —
          the direct knowledge (abhiññā) that underpins liberation. It is not an endpoint but
          a launching ground.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Jhāna and Insight</h2>

        <p>
          A longstanding and genuinely difficult debate in the Pali tradition concerns the
          relationship between jhāna and insight (<span class="pali" data-pali="paññā" data-en="wisdom">paññā</span>).
          The <em>samatha-vipassanā</em> debate — calm versus insight, deep concentration versus
          moment-to-moment observation — has occupied commentators for centuries. Does liberation
          require full jhāna? Can it arise through bare insight practice without absorption?
        </p>

        <p>
          The canonical texts suggest something like this: the fourth jhāna provides an ideal
          basis for the penetrating clarity of wisdom, but the path does not describe a strict
          sequence in which jhāna must fully precede insight. Rather, they mutually support each
          other. A mind that is deeply still can see more clearly. Seeing more clearly deepens
          stillness. The metaphor of a hand steady enough to perform surgery — where the steadiness
          of <span class="pali" data-pali="samādhi" data-en="unification">samādhi</span>
          enables the precision of
          <span class="pali" data-pali="paññā" data-en="wisdom">paññā</span> — is apt.
        </p>

        <p>
          What the texts are clear about is that liberation does not come from jhāna alone.
          A practitioner can enter and exit all four jhānas and remain unawakened if they have
          not applied wisdom to what is observed there. Jhāna provides the conditions; wisdom
          does the seeing.
        </p>

        <h2>Beyond the Four: Formless Absorptions</h2>

        <p>
          Beyond the four rūpa-jhānas (form absorptions), the tradition describes four arūpa-jhānas
          (formless absorptions): the base of infinite space, the base of infinite consciousness,
          the base of nothingness, and the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. These
          represent further refinements of
          <span class="pali" data-pali="samādhi" data-en="unification">samādhi</span> in which even
          the subtle sense of a physical body as the object has been released.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the sutta literature, the formless absorptions appear in the Buddha's biography as
          the states he learned from his pre-awakening teachers and then went beyond — not because
          they are wrong, but because even the most refined absorption is still
          <span class="pali" data-pali="saṅkhāra" data-en="formations">conditioned</span>, still
          <span class="pali" data-pali="anicca" data-en="impermanent">impermanent</span>, and
          unable by itself to uproot <span class="pali" data-pali="avijjā" data-en="ignorance">avijjā</span>.
          Stillness without wisdom is peace without release.
